## About the project
PORTFOLIO is a lightweight, responsive personal portfolio website implemented in JavaScript. It is intended to showcase projects, skills, resume details, and provide a contact mechanism for potential collaborators or employers.

This repository is 100% JavaScript.

Goals:
- Clean, modern design
- Fast and accessible
- Easy to customize and deploy (GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify)

## Features
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Project gallery with links and descriptions
- Skills section (icons or progress bars)
- About / resume section
- Contact form or mailto link
- Smooth scrolling and basic animations
- SEO-ready meta tags (editable)

## Built with
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3 (or a CSS framework — replace with Tailwind / Bootstrap if used)
- Optional build tools: npm, Webpack, Vite, or Parcel

(Replace or expand the list with the exact frameworks/tools used in this repo.)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>= 14.x) and npm (or yarn) if the project uses a bundler or dev server.
- A browser to view the site.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/jpriyanshu171/PORTFOLIO.git

2. Change directory
   cd PORTFOLIO

3. Install dependencies (if applicable)
   npm install

If the project is purely static (no build step), you can skip installing dependencies.

### Running locally
Start the development server (example commands; replace with your repo's scripts):

- With npm (Vite/webpack/parcel):
  npm run dev

- Or open index.html directly in the browser if there’s no dev server.

### Building for production
If using a bundler:
npm run build

The production-ready files will be placed in the configured output directory (for example, dist/ or build/).

## Deployment
Common deployment options:

- GitHub Pages:
  - If static: push the build output or the repository root (for user/organization pages use the docs/ or root branch as needed).
  - For a React/Vite build, configure GitHub Actions or use the gh-pages npm package.

- Vercel:
  - Connect the repo, configure build command (npm run build), and set the output directory (dist/ or build/).

- Netlify:
  - Connect the repo and configure build command & publish directory.

Add any environment variables or settings required by your specific project.

## Usage
- Edit content in the appropriate files (index.html, src/, components, or data folder) to add your projects and personal info.
- Replace placeholder images and demo links with real screenshots and URLs.
- Update meta tags for SEO in the head of index.html.

Example: To add a new project, add an entry in src/data/projects.js (or the projects section in HTML) with:
- title
- description
- tech stack
- link (live)
- repo (source)

## Project structure
(Adjust to match your repository; example:)
- public/ or assets/ — static files (images, icons)
- src/ — JavaScript source files
  - index.js — app entry
  - components/ — UI components
  - styles/ — CSS or preprocessor files
- index.html — main HTML file
- package.json — scripts and dependencies
- README.md — this file

## Customization guide
Replace the following placeholders:
- Site title and description in index.html (meta tags)
- Author name and contact info in the About/Contact section
- Project cards: update titles, descriptions, images, links
- Theme colors: update CSS variables or theme file
- Fonts: update link to Google Fonts or local fonts

Tips:
- Keep images optimized (WebP/optimized JPEG/PNG)
- Use descriptive alt attributes for accessibility
- Test responsiveness using browser dev tools
